# Arduino Sensor Monitoring App

This app provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring sensor data collected by Arduino-based IoT devices. Whether you're tracking temperature, humidity, light intensity, or any other environmental parameter, this app simplifies the process of visualizing and analyzing real-time sensor readings.

## Key Features:
+ **Real-time Data Visualization**: View sensor data in real-time through intuitive charts and graphs.
+ **Customizable Dashboards**: Create personalized dashboards to display the specific sensor data you're interested in.
+ **Alert Notifications**: Set thresholds for sensor values and receive notifications when they exceed predefined limits.
+ **Data Logging**: Store historical sensor data for analysis and trend identification.

## How It Works:
1. Connect your Arduino device(s) to the app via USB, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth.
2. Select the sensors you want to monitor and configure their settings.
3. Visualize real-time sensor data on the app's dashboard.
4. Set up alerts to receive notifications when sensor readings go beyond specified thresholds.
5. Analyze historical data to identify patterns and trends over time.
